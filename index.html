        My name is Alexis Trinidad Martin. My friends mostly call me “Lex”. I am 19 years old. I was born on the 27th of February of 2002. I spent my junior and senior high school in Taguig Science High School which was located on barangay San Miguel in Taguig City. Luckily, with hard work and patience, I graduated as an honor STEM student from that school. I am currently enrolled in the BSIT course major in Mobile and Internet Technologies. I have a 60 % discount scholarship since my father is an active soldier. </p>

        <br>I am not a transferee nor someone taking BSIT as a second course. I made my own decision in choosing this course instead of engineering or agricultural tech since I know being in the IT field has also been by far one of the interesting dreams I have since I was a child. I know deep down that this path is somehow something I won’t be regretting for the rest of my life. I would be in either the agricultural technology or engineering field specifically aeronautics if I won't be taking BSIT. I have moderate experience in programming, I actually started from scratch since I did not come from a STEM strand specializing in IT unlike the majority of my current classmates. I know HTML, CSS, C#, C++, SQL, JavaScript, some Java, and Python. My hobbies would include gaming in my extra time, watching movies and series, hanging out and drinking with my favorite circle, and trying out some investments through cryptos.</p>
    <p class="tab">
        <br>My main goal in life is simple, I wanted to be someone successful in the IT field that has the skills, knowledge, and experiences that was needed to be one of the people that also helps other persons through the correct and efficient use of technology. I wanted to be someone with good experience and connections that may help me in starting a technology-related business when the right time comes. I expect to learn the essential tips and tricks in dealing not just in Web programming but other programming languages that may be essential to us given that our professor is someone that has several achievements in the IT field. I wanted to learn and apply good characteristics, and the past experiences of someone who has long been in the IT industry that can assist me in growing into stronger and a better version of myself that will be of big help in my chosen major in the long run.
